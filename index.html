                    <p id="top-para">My name is Viviana Garcia. I have experience with HTML, CSS and JavaScript and actively seeking front-end web developer positions. I am currently a digital media student at Northwest Vista College. I am also currently enrolled in an online full stack web development bootcamp through UT Austin. I'm expected to graduate and be completed with the bootcamp by July 2020.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p id="middle-para clearfix">During my coursework, my passion for UX (user experience) has grown and will be something I focus on when pursuing my Bachelors' degree. I am motivated and driven to learn all about web development and is something I truly enjoy.
                    My career goal is to work in a collaborative team setting with peers with a wide range of expertise. I would eventually love to also learn how to build mobile applications.

                    <p id="bottom-para">When I am not coding, I am a mom to two daughters and a wife to my wonderful husband. I am a foodie and enjoying cooking, trying new recipes and eating at local spots.
                    I also enjoy listening to music and discovering new artists. I enjoy attending live music events when I have the chance.
